                <p class="large-text">The Bible is God's perfect account of what He has done. It was diligently written down by ordinary
                    people who were willing to follow God's design. Over the years, faithful men and women have worked
                    to keep the Bible accessible and preserved.

                <h2>Translation</h2>
                <p>Because of its availability and widespread consistency, we use the KJV from the pulpit to give
                    everyone an opportunity to use the same wording of the texts which we are studying.

                <h2>The Trinity</h2>
                <p>Pastor Brian recounts,"my grandparents were so perfect for each other that i could hardly imagine
                    them apart. They as well as their names, Billie and Millie, fit so perfectly it was like they were
                    made as a pair. When Grandpa passed, Grandma wasn't the same and didn't last much longer. The Bible
                    says that is a shadow of the Trinity, seperate but inseparable." Another illustration is how a
                    person is body, mind, soul, and spirit. We can't remove a part without consequences. Likewise, the
                    Father, Son, and Spirit work as 3 aspects of the same.

                        <h3>The Father</h3>
                        <p>Often seen as the Great Judge on the throne in heaven, God the Father demands perfection for
                            entry
                            into His kingdom. He is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. He tends the branches on
                            the vine
                            which is Christ.<br/>John 15:1-27

                        <h3>The Son</h3>
                        <p>Christ, the beloved of the Father. Through Him everything was created and by Him it exists.
                            He was
                            conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, grew as human with mortal
                            constraints. He
                            suffered, died, was buried, and rose again to sit at the right hand of the Father. He stands
                            as the
                            perfect atonement our sin.

                        <h3>The Holy Spirit</h3>
                        <p>Essentially, when the Holy Spirit moves, things happen for God's glory. We believe God can
                            move as He
                            wills and is not bound by our views. We also see many churches that defile the words about
                            the Holy
                            Spirit to gain glory and attention for themselves. We cautiously believe the Holy Spirit as
                            through
                            Bazalel, can nurture and enhance our talents for God's glory.

                <h2>Salvation</h2>
                <p>One of the greatest disasters to hit the church is the movement which centers on man as the
                    protagonist of salvation. We neither claim to follow belief sets as designed by men, nor address man
                    as causing salvation. Salvation is a Holy Almighty God calling us to be reconciled to Him. He wrote
                    the whole story, we get to be the clay in the Master's hands <em>Isaiah 64:8</em>. To become a
                    Christian is to change
                    your perspective, put off the old ways, and become a new creation created unto good works which God
                    designed.

            <div class="section-content">
                <h2>Faith</h2>
                <p>Hope is our confident expectation that God will not change and that He will remain in control of
                    whatever situations may happen. Faith, as the substance and evidence therein, is the actions we take
                    that prove our hope. Works cannot save someone, but as saved, we are called to express our faith,
                    lest it be as useful as a screen door on a submarine.

                <h2>Marriage</h2>
                <p>As the earthly representation of the Trinity, we wholeheartedly believe that marriage was designed to
                    be the union between one man and one woman and that it cannot change and remain glorifying to God.
                    The cultural consequences of our society are more devastating than have been willing to even
                    address.
