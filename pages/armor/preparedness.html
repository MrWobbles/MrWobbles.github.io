        <h2>Preparedness</h2>
        <p>Ephesians 6:15 refers to the spiritual footwear of a believer's armor, highlighting the importance of being
          firmly grounded in faith and readiness to spread the gospel of peace. Just as sturdy feet provide stability
          and movement on physical ground, the feet of the armor of God help a Christian to stand firm against spiritual
          challenges and walk confidently in the path of righteousness. By wearing the shoes of peace, believers are
          equipped to engage in spiritual warfare, bringing harmony, love, and understanding to a world often torn apart
          by conflict. This component of the armor shows the importance of being prepared, steadfast, and motivated by
          faith and love in your spiritual journey.

        <p class="large-text">Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of
          God, so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and
          blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the
          spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the
          day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.
          Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in
          place, and <strong>with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.</strong> In
          addition to
          all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
          Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the
          Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on
          praying for all the Lord's people.
