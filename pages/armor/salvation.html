        <h2>Salvation</h2>
        <p>The Helmet of Salvation represents the assurance and protection that come from having a relationship with God
          through Jesus Christ. Just like a helmet shields a soldier's head in battle, the Helmet of Salvation guards
          our minds and thoughts from doubts and spiritual attacks. It represents the confidence we gain from knowing
          that we are saved and loved by God, and that nothing can separate us from His grace. By wearing this spiritual
          helmet, we can have peace and hope, even in challenging times. The Helmet of Salvation reminds us to hold onto
          our faith and trust in God's promises, allowing us to live with courage and purpose, knowing that our ultimate
          salvation is secured through Jesus Christ.

        <p class="large-text">Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of
          God, so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and
          blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the
          spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the
          day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.
          Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of
          righteousness in
          place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In
          addition to
          all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
          <strong>Take the helmet of salvation</strong> and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray
          in the
          Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on
          praying for all the Lord's people.
