        <h2>Righteousness</h2>
        <p>The Breastplate of Righteousness represents a powerful symbol of protection and integrity in the spiritual
          armor of believers. Just as a physical breastplate shields a soldier's chest in battle, this piece of armor
          guards a person's heart and soul. It emphasizes the importance of living a righteous and moral life, doing
          what is right in the eyes of God and others. By wearing this spiritual breastplate, we are shielded from
          temptations and negative influences that could harm our inner selves. It reminds us to walk in goodness,
          honesty, and fairness, and to stand strong in our values and beliefs, ensuring we lead a life worthy of God's
          approval.

        <p class="large-text">Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of
          God, so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and
          blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the
          spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the
          day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.
          Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, <strong>with the breastplate of
            righteousness in
            place</strong>, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In
          addition to
          all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
          Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the
          Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on
          praying for all the Lord's people.
