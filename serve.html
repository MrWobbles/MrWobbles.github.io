                    Substantial
                    expectation or hope is visible and tangible. Faith is not some lofty thing that sounds unattainable.
                    Simply put,
                    if you really expect God to move, you should be moving too. Wherever you may find yourself in your
                    walk with God
                    right now, there is always a next step.</p>

                <p>If you have yet to attend one of our Sunday morning worship services in person, being here in 
                    person would be the first goal. We are thrilled to offer streamed services, but they cannot 
                    compare to fellowshipping and worshiping in person with fellow believers. While you are at it, 
                    join us for breakfast at 9:30 and Bible Study at 10:00. This is a great way to learn more about 
                    God's Word. If you have yet to visit our church, we are quite easy to find- we are right behind 
                    the grain elevators off Highway 123 or "in the shadow of the harvest".

                            <p>Bible Study is a crucial part of drawing closer to God and foundational to a solid walk for believers. To help believers find depth and discipline to be complete and strong disciples, we offer several formats of training. Our primary offering is at 10 on Sunday morning. We also offer classes on Sunday evening which are geared toward youth in that they address modern issues, but are welcome to all ages. Our Foundations program on Wednesday night is geared toward kids. It teaches foundational attributes to a believer's walk.

                    <p class="large-text">If God is calling you in a new direction whether big or small, we believe there are 
                        general protocols to follow:

                                <h3>Prayer</h3>
                                <p>We believe God desires for us to act as one body in unison following Him. We 
                                    always start a new endeavor by making sure it is the right direction at the 
                                    right time</p>

                                <h3>Resource</h3>
                                <p>If God is in it, who can stand against. God will provide the resources for the 
                                    things He wants to happen. Likewise, He will not bless something for our own 
                                    glory. We desire to follow God fully in everything. If we cease to follow God, 
                                    we will fail.</p>

                                <p>This is the part we often dread as humans, but if God has called you to something, 
                                    we need to make sure you are fully equipped for the task. Whether it means laying 
                                    on of hands to surround you in prayer or helping you take some classes, we want 
                                    able workers for the Kingdom of God</p>

                                <p>Our church has taken great strides to be above reproach. We will not associate 
                                    with an endeavor that could compromise our witness. This reinforces our idea of 
                                    Resource, we believe if God wills it, He will prepare the way for us to do it 
                                    right for His glory.

                <h2>Running to Completion</h2>
                <p>
                    In our day and age, it is a tragedy that many believers leave the race or veer from the path.
                    Many of the leaders and workers in our church see ourselves as fighting for peoples' lives
                    as if we were fighting for our own. If you are seasoned in the journey, take time to
                    encourage other workers. Encouragement can go a long way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No matter where you are in the journey, here at Calvary Baptist Church, there is something
                    for you.
